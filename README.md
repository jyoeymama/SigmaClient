# SigmaClient
This is a hack client for scenexe2.io using tampermonkey
How to install : The first thing that you need to do is install Tampermonkey and enable tampermonkey as a extension to your browser. Make sure developer mode is turned on for tampermonkey so it can inject the code making the client usable. Then go into extensions and click on create new script. Then, delete all the code in the new script making it blank. Then go into the file on my github called SigmaClientMain.javascript. Copy the code in SigmaClientMain.javascript and go back into tampermonkey with you empty new script and paste the code into the new script. Then in the top right corner click on File, then click on save. Then turn it on using the little green or gray switch in tampermonkey. Make sure its on by looking at the little green switch. Then go into Scenexe2.io and reload the page. Then simply press the key V to activate the client and enjoy!

IF you have any issues then go back to my github and report it in the issues tab. Support my work by staring this repository. Thank you agian and enjoy Sigma Client v1!
